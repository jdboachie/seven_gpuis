# seven_gpuis

Overview
--------
[`7GUIs`](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/) is a small GUI programming benchmark consisting of seven short tasks that exercise common GUI features (e.g. counter, temperature conversion, lists, etc.). This repository implements (parts of) that benchmark using the `gpui` GUI library by Zed Industries.

Why "seven gpuis"
------------------
The name "seven gpuis" is a play on the original `7GUIs` benchmark and the `gpui` library used here — each example is implemented with `gpui`, so it's literally "seven gpuis".

What this repo contains
-----------------------
- [counter](./counter)
- [temperature_converter](./temperature_converter)
- [ui](./ui) — shared UI code and harness used by the examples

Notes
-----
- Work in progress — some examples are implemented, others are planned
- This project uses the `gpui` library by Zed Industries to build tiny, focused GUI samples.
- Feedback is welcome, contributions... not so much.
