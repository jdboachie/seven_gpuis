# seven_gpuis

Overview
--------
[`7GUIs`](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/) is a small GUI programming benchmark consisting of seven tasks that exercise common GUI features. This repository aims to implement that benchmark using the `gpui` GUI library by [Zed Industries](https://zed.dev).
The name "seven gpuis" is a play on the original `7GUIs` benchmark and the `gpui` library used here. Each example is implemented with `gpui`, so it's literally "seven gpuis" 😅

What this repo contains
-----------------------

- [ui](./ui) — shared UI code
1. [counter](./counter)
2. [temperature_converter](./temperature_converter)
3. [flight_booker](./flight_booker)

Notes
-----
- I plan to write on the theoretical aspects of this (explaining the benchmark, what each task assesses and how gpui handles it)
- Work in progress — some examples are implemented, others are planned
- This project uses the `gpui` library by Zed Industries to build tiny, focused GUI samples.
- Feedback is welcome, contributions... not so much.
